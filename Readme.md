## About:
Betterforums is a simple and easy to understand alternative to conventional social media by focussing on the anonymous aspect of online communication.

It is designed to be selfhosted, see [SETUP](https://github.com/xNaCly/betterforum/blob/master/SETUP.md) for a guide

It is built around the idea of text-based communication and only supports inline link highlighting, rendering of images or links is not intended.

Posts can be created easily and contain a title, (main)-content and optional the author. Comments follow the same structure. Providing the created Post with a username will result in the username being hashed to allow other users to distinguish between unique users and to allow a way of authentication, not providing a name will result in the author being made of Anonymous# + a random range of characters (4chars len).
